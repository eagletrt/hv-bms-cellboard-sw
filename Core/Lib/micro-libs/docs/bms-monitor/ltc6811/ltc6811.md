# Ltc6811

The **Ltc6811** is a 12 cell battery stack monitor chip with support for all the
basic operations of a BMS as well as some advanced features.

This library act as a layer of abstraction for the chip commands, translating
human readable data in bytes that can be understood by the ltc and viceversa.

## Concept

Communication with the ltc6811 can be done via its predefined 11-bit commands,
that can also be followed by other data if needed.

This library offers an *hardware independent layer* where each function can be used
to encode or decode data to or from the byte format used by the chip.

!!! note
    The actual communication with the peripheral and the chip is left to the user making
    this library more flexible and generic.
